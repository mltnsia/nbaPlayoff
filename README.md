# nbaPlayoff
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the most lucrative sports leagues globally, with a whopping annual revenue of about $10 billion in 2022. Booms in sports teams valuations over the past decade coupled with the NBA opening up alternative investment sources, such as sovereign wealth funds and private equity, make it a ripe picking ground for an increasing number of investors. 

We will build a model to predict teams that make it into the Playoffs in the subsequent season. Our model will take team and player stats, results from past seasons and sentiment from social media sites like Twitter and Reddit, along with news sites such as the New York Times to predict the next seasonâ€™s results. The sentiment analysis will be done using the pre-season period, which is 3 months before the season starts. We believe that the news and discussions during this time captures information that historical statistics cannot. Therefore, this will help investors to make more informed decisions on which teams to invest in to get the highest returns.
